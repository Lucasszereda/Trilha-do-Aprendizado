		<h1>Borboletas</h1>

		<h2>Victor e Leo</h2>

		<p>Percebo que o tempo já não passa<br>
		Você diz que não tem graça amar assim<br>
		Foi tudo tão bonito, mas voou pro infinito<br>
		Parecido com borboletas de um jardim<br>
		Agora você volta<br>
		E balança o que eu sentia por outro alguém<br>
		Dividido entre dois mundos<br>
		Sei que estou amando, mas ainda não sei quem<br>
		Não sei dizer o que mudou<br>
		Mas nada está igual<br>
		Numa noite estranha a gente se estranha e fica mal<br>
		Você tenta provar que tudo em nós morreu<br>
		Borboletas sempre voltam<br>
		E o seu jardim sou eu<br>

		<h1>Californication</h1>

		<h2>Red Hot Chili Peppers</h2>
		<p>Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation<br>
		And little girls from Sweden dream of silver screen quotation<br>
		And if you want these kind of dreams it's Californication<br>
		It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization<br>
		The sun may rise in the East at least it's settled in a final location<br>
		It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication<br>
		Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging<br>
		Celebrity skin, is this your chin, or is that war you're waging?<br>
		First born unicorn<br>
		Hardcore soft porn<br>
		Dream of Californication<br>
		Dream of Californication<br>
		Dream of Californication<br>
		Dream of Californication<br>
		Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation<br>
		A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information<br>
		And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication<br>
		Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement<br>
		And Cobain can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station To Station?<br>
		And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication<br>
		Born and raised by those who praise control of population<br>
		Well, everybody's been there and I don't mean on vacation<br>
		First born unicorn<br>
		Hardcore soft porn<br>
		Dream of Californication<br>
		Dream of Californication<br>
		Dream of Californication<br>
		Dream of Californication<br>
		Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation<br>
		And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration<br>
		And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication<br>
		Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging<br>
		Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving?<br>
		First born unicorn<br>
		Hardcore soft porn<br>
		Dream of Californication<br>
		Dream of Californication<br>
		Dream of Californication<br>
		Dream of Californication<br></p>

		<h1>Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)</h1>

		<h2>Eurythmics</h2>

		<p>Sweet dreams are made of this<br>
		Who am I to disagree<br>
		I travel the world and the seven seas<br>
		Everybody's looking for something<br>
		Some of them want to use you<br>
		Some of them want to get used by you<br>
		Some of them want to abuse you<br>
		Some of them want to be abused<br>
		Sweet dreams are made of this<br>
		Who am I to disagree<br>
		I travel the world and the seven seas<br>
		Everybody's looking for something<br>
		Hold your head up, keep your head up, movin' on<br>
		Hold your head up, movin' on, keep your head up, movin' on<br>
		Hold your head up, movin' on, keep your head up, movin' on<br>
		Hold your head up, movin' on, keep your head up<br>

		<h1>Can’t Stop</h1>
		<h2>Red Hot Chili Peppers</h2>
		<p>Can't stop addicted to the shindig<br>
		Chop top he says I'm gonna win big<br>
		Choose not a life of imitation<br>
		Distant cousin to the reservation<br>
		Defunkt the pistol that you pay for<br>
		This punk the feeling that you stay for<br>
		In time I want to be your best friend<br>
		Eastside love is living on the Westend<br>
		Knock out but boy you better come to<br>
		Don't die you know the truth is some do<br>
		Go write your message on the pavement<br>
		Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant<br>
		White heat is screaming in the jungle<br>
		Complete the motion if you stumble<br>
		Go ask the dust for any answers<br>
		Come back strong with 50 belly dancers<br>
		The world I love<br>
		The tears I drop<br>
		To be part of<br>
		The wave can't stop<br>
		Ever wonder if it's all for you<br>
		The world I love<br>
		The trains I hop<br>
		To be part of<br>
		The wave can't stop<br>
		Come and tell me when it's time to<br>
		Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone<br>
		So smart she's leading me to ozone<br>
		Music the great communicator<br>
		Use two sticks to make it in the nature<br>
		I'll get you into penetration<br>
		The gender of a generation<br>
		The birth of every other nation<br>
		Worth your weight the gold of meditation<br>
		This chapter's going to be a close one<br>
		Smoke rings I know your going to blow one<br>
		All on a spaceship persevering<br>
		Use my hands for everything but steering<br>
		Can't stop the spirits when they need you<br>
		Moptops are happy when they feed you<br>
		J. Butterfly is in the treetop<br>
		Birds that blow the meaning into bebop<br>
		The world I love<br>
		The tears I drop<br>
		To be part of<br>
		The wave can't stop<br>
		Ever wonder if it's all for you<br>
		The world I love<br>
		The trains I hop<br>
		To be part of<br>
		The wave can't stop<br>
		Come and tell me when it's time to<br>
		Wait a minute I'm passing out<br>
		Win or lose just like you<br>
		Far more shocking<br>
		Than anything I ever knew<br>
		How about you<br>
		Ten more reasons<br>
		Why I need somebody new just like you<br>
		Far more shocking than anything I ever knew<br>
		Right on cue<br>
		Can't stop addicted to the shindig<br>
		Chop top he says I'm gonna win big<br>
		Choose not a life of imitation<br>
		Distant cousin to the reservation<br>
		Defunkt the pistol that you pay for<br>
		This punk the feeling that you stay for<br>
		In time I want to be your best friend<br>
		Eastside love is living on the Westend<br>
		Knock out but boy you better come to<br>
		Don't die you know the truth is some do<br>
		Go write your message on the pavement<br>
		Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant<br>
		Kick start the golden generator<br>
		Sweet talk but don't intimidate her<br>
		Can't stop the gods from engineering<br>
		Feel no need for any interfering<br>
		Your image in the dictionary<br>
		This life is more than ordinary<br>
		Can I get two maybe even three of these<br>
		Coming from space<br>
		To teach you of the Pleides<br>
		Can't stop the spirits when they need you<br>
		This life is more than just a read through<br></p>
